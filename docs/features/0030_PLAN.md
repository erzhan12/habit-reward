# Feature 0030 Plan: Default reward category to Real and hide it in creation flow

## Context
The reward creation flow should skip the “Category” step and default it to **Real**. The field should remain in storage and APIs, but it should not appear in any user-facing messages during reward creation. This plan implements: “during creation of a new reward let’s skip this the step Category and put Real by default and don’t show in any messages”.

## Relevant Files & Functions
- `src/bot/handlers/reward_handlers.py`
  - `reward_name_received()` (currently transitions to type selection)
  - `_format_reward_summary()` (includes reward type in confirmation)
  - `reward_confirm_save()` (reads `reward_data['type']`)
  - `add_reward_conversation` state transitions (type selection state)
- `src/bot/messages.py`
  - `HELP_ADD_REWARD_TYPE_PROMPT` and `HELP_ADD_REWARD_CONFIRM` content
  - Reward-type button labels (still used by edit flow)
- `src/bot/keyboards.py`
  - `build_reward_type_keyboard()` (used by add flow today, remains for edit flow)
- `tests/test_bot_handlers.py`
  - Add/adjust tests for `/add_reward` flow expectations

## Plan
### 1) Update reward creation flow to default “Real” without a type step
- In `reward_name_received()`, after storing the reward name, set `reward_data['type'] = RewardType.REAL` and immediately proceed to the weight prompt (skip `build_reward_type_keyboard()` and the type prompt message).
- Remove the type-selection state from `add_reward_conversation` so the flow transitions directly from name → weight (keeping edit flow unchanged).
- Ensure `reward_confirm_save()` still uses the stored type when calling `reward_service.create_reward()` so the backend field remains populated.

### 2) Remove reward type from creation messages
- Update `_format_reward_summary()` to omit the reward type from the confirmation summary for add flow.
- Update `HELP_ADD_REWARD_CONFIRM` in `src/bot/messages.py` to remove the “Type” line so type is not shown in any confirmation message.
- Leave `HELP_ADD_REWARD_TYPE_PROMPT` and type buttons intact for edit flow unless unused globally; do not surface them in the add flow.

### 3) Tests
Add or update tests in `tests/test_bot_handlers.py` to cover:
- `/add_reward` flow skips the type step and immediately sends the weight prompt after name input.
- Reward creation uses `RewardType.REAL` by default when no user input is provided.
- Confirmation message for add flow does not include any type/category line.

## Notes
- No changes are required to models, migrations, or APIs; the reward type/category remains in the data model and edit flow.
- If any localization keys become unused in add flow, leave them in place for edit flow to avoid breaking existing UX.
